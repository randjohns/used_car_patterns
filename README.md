Discovering Sale Pricing Trends Related to Features and Condition of Used Cars

This project is my customization and extension of a guided project from the Dataquest.io platform course, "Pandas and NumPy Fundamentals." I found the following course, "Exploratory Data Visualization," to be so useful that I couldn't resist adding charts to the project!

Enjoy!
